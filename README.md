# Hello ðŸ™Œ

Hello!

I'm Srinivas Reddy Thatiparthy, a passionate developer with a focus on freelance and open-source projects. My journey in programming began with Python, a language I deeply appreciate for its versatility and ease of use. However, my curiosity and drive for learning have led me to explore and fall in love with other languages like Rust and C, known for their performance and control. Additionally, I dabble in JavaScript, adding a dynamic edge to my skill set.

I'm currently open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you're looking for a developer who is enthusiastic about coding and brings a diverse range of programming knowledge, feel free to reach out.
